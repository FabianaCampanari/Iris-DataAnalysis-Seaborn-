#  <p align="center"> ðŸŒ¸ Iris Data Analysis with Seaborn 

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for analyzing the famous Iris dataset using the Seaborn library. The goal is to demonstrate how to load, visualize, and analyze data with Seaborn and pandas.

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- numpy

You can install these libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install pandas seaborn matplotlib numpy
```

## Introduction

This Jupyter notebook contains various code blocks that perform different tasks for data analysis and visualization. Below, we explain each of the code blocks present in the Seaborniris.ipynb file.

### Importing Libraries

First, we import the necessary libraries for data analysis and visualization.

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
```

## Generating Data

We create a sequence of x values ranging from -5 to 5, with 100 equally spaced points.

```python
x = np.linspace(-5, 5, 100)
```
